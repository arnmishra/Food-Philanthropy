# Food Philanthropy

According to the *National Geographic*, about 30% of the food we grow is wasted every year. However, with constant advent of new technology, newfound advances and innovations have begun to offer solutions.

This project utilizes the Google, Postmates, and Uber APIs in conjunction to provide stores an easy manner in which food and other goods can be given to those in need. 

### Workflow:
- Company goes to website and creates an account
- Company enters pickup and dropoff location
- Company selects Uber or Postmates for delivery
- Driver arrives and takes food to the pantry

Work In Progress.
